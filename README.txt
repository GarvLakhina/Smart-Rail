# Browser Simulation (Leaflet)
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. You will see:
- 10 stations, network lines
- 30 trains moving live (1s tick)
- Trains in **red** are in **collision risk window 15–20 minutes** time-to-collision (same track, roughly head-on).

## How to run
Just open `index.html` (double-click). Requires internet to load the Leaflet and OSM tiles.

## Controls
- Pan/zoom the map freely.
